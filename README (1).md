# Fraud Transaction Detection Using Python


For my project, I developed and implemented a comprehensive system for processing transaction data through four distinct modules: dataset, distance, statistics, and test. The dataset module reads transaction data and organizes it into a nested dictionary, efficiently handling attributes like user ID, transaction ID, description, amount, location coordinates, and fraud labels. The distance module employs two functions to calculate Euclidean distances between transactions, either within a single user's transactions or between different users' transactions. The statistics module offers twelve functions to compute various statistics on transaction data, such as averages, medians, and standard deviations, and includes capabilities to identify fraudulent transactions and outliers. Finally, the test module provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that facilitates interaction with the functionalities of the other modules.

# Top Findings and Interpretation
This project taught me the intricacies of handling large datasets and the importance of creating structured and readable code without relying on external libraries. The dataset's initial disorganization posed a significant challenge, but converting it into a nested dictionary clarified the data structure and facilitated subsequent analysis. The distance module's implementation underscored the value of using libraries and constants to maintain clean code and demonstrated the effectiveness of breaking complex problems into manageable parts. The statistics module enhanced my understanding of various statistical measures and introduced me to concepts like Z-scores and nth percentiles. Additionally, constructing the test module's interface reinforced the importance of user-centric design in software development. Overall, this project significantly enhanced my Python programming skills and provided a practical framework for developing efficient and user-friendly data processing systems.
